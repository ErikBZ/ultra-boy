TODO: Fix up Player Controller.
	I put in some TODOs there. To fix the double jumping issue all you have to do is
	put a circle collider at the bottom of the game object. - THAI

TODO: Create the Camera rigging so it follows the player. - DAVID

TODO: If the player hits a "hazard" which can be something like a spike, or enemy,
	then they must die. For now just output "Player hit by enemy/hazard" onto the console
